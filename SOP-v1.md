# Creating Beginner-Friendly Open Source Issues 

### 1. Purpose 
The goal of this process is to prepare and publish a "good first issue" that helps onboard new contributors by providing a clear, low-risk entry point into an open-source project. 

### 2. Scope 
This SOP covers the identification of a task, drafting the issue, labeling, and publishing it to a GitHub repository. It applies to open source project maintainers who manage issues on GitHub and want to onboard first-time contributors. 
- Out of Scope: Future interactions such as assigning the issue after interest is expressed, reviewing pull requests, or long-term mentoring. 

### 3. Roles 
Maintainer: Responsible for identifying suitable tasks, drafting clear documentation, creating the issue, and ensuring that it is discoverable. 

### 4. Inputs & Outputs 
##### Inputs:  
- A GitHub repository with issues enabled 
- An identified documentation improvement or small, low-risk task that does not affect core functionality. 
- Issue Template (Optional): The presence of a pre-configured .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE file for onboarding or first-time contributors. 

##### Outputs:  
- A published GitHub issue labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" or “wishlist” that is visible to the public. 
- A clear, welcoming issue description that guides new contributors 

### 5. Numbered Steps 
- Identify a Suitable Task: Recognize a small or low-risk task, such as a documentation improvement, that is suitable for a first-time contributor. 
- Open the GitHub repository 
- Navigate to the repository homepage where the task will be created. 
- Verify Originality: Navigate to the Issues tab on the GitHub repository and scan existing entries to ensure the task has not already been reported or assigned. 
- Initiate New Issue: Click the New Issue button. If the project provides specific onboarding or "good first issue" templates, select the appropriate one. 
- Draft the Title: Create a title that describes the task in simple, non-technical language to ensure it is easily understood. 
- Write the Description: Complete the issue body including: 
  - Background Context: Explain why the task is needed. 
  - Resources: Specify which files or documentation are involved. 
  - Definition of Success: Clearly state what the completed task should look like. 
  - Supportive Links: Include links to relevant information to help the contributor solve the task with minimal follow-up questions. 

- Review for Clarity: Scroll back through the draft to check that the language is welcoming, acronyms are explained, and the scope is limited enough for a beginner. 
- Apply Labels: Apply labels such as "good first issue" or "help wanted" to make the task discoverable to new users. 
- Determine Assignment: For onboarding issues, leave the issue unassigned so that interested contributors can express interest themselves. 
- Publish: Click Submit new issue to make the task public in the repository. 

### 6. Exceptions 
- Existing Tasks: If the scan of the Issues tab (Step 2) reveals that the task is already documented or being worked on, do not create a duplicate issue. 
- Complex Tasks: If a task is found to affect core functionality or requires advanced technical knowledge, it should not be labeled as a "good first issue".
